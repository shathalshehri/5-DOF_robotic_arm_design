# 5-DOF Robotic Arm Design

This repository provides the design and documentation for a 5-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm. This project was developed as part of a mechanical engineering task during my training at Smart Methods.

## Project Overview

The project involves replicating a 5-DOF robotic arm design using Tinkercad. This exercise is part of the mechanical engineering track at Smart Methods, aimed at mastering robotic arm design principles.

## Files Included

- **Tinkercad Design**: [5DOF Robotic Arm Design on Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/djf7sOwBCG2-5-dof-robotic-arm-designtinkercad) - View and copy the design directly on Tinkercad.
- **STL File**: [5-DOF Robotic Arm STL](https://github.com/shathalshehri/5-DOF_robotic_arm_design/blob/main/5-DOF-robotic-arm-design.stl) - The STL file for 3D printing the robotic arm.

## Tutorial Video
